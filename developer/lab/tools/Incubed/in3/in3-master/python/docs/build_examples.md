### Running the examples

To run an example, you need to install in3 first:
```sh
pip install in3
```
This will install the library system-wide. Please consider using `virtualenv` or `pipenv` for a project-wide install.

Then copy one of the examples and paste into a file, i.e. `example.py`:

`MacOS`
```sh
pbpaste > example.py
```

Execute the example with python:
```
python example.py
```

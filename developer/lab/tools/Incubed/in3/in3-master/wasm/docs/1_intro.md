# API Reference TS/JS

Even though the IN3 client is written in C, we are using emscripten to build wasm. Together with some binding-code IN3 runs in any Javascript-Runtime.
Using WASM gives us 3 important features:

1. Performance.
   Since WASM runs at almost native speed it is very fast

2. Security
   Since the WASM-Module has no dependencies it reduces the risk of using a malicious dependency, which would be able to manipulate Prototypes.
   Also, since the real work is happening inside the wasm, trying to change Prototype would not work.

3. Size
   The current wasm-file is about 200kb. This is smaller then most other libraries and can easily be used in any app or website.


## Installing

This client uses the in3-core sources compiled to wasm. The wasm is included into the js-file wich makes it easier to include the data.
This module has **no** dependencies! All it needs is included inta a wasm of about 300kB.

Installing IN3 is as easy as installing any other module:

```
npm install --save in3
```


### WASM-support

Even though most browsers and javascript enviroment such as nodejs, have full support for wasm, there are ocasions, where WASM is fully supported.
In case you want to run IN3 within a react native app, you might face such issues. In this case you can use [in3-asmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/in3-asmjs), which has the same API, but runs on pure javascript (a bit slower and bigger, but full support everywhere).

## Building from Source

### install emscripten

In order to build the wasm or asmjs from source you need to install emscripten first. In case you have not done it yet:

```sh
# Get the emsdk repo
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git

# Enter that directory
cd emsdk

# install the latest-upstream sdk and activate it
./emsdk install latest-upstream && ./emsdk activate latest-upstream
```

```sh
# Please make sure you add this line to your .bash_profile or .zshrc
source <PATH_TO_EMSDK>/emsdk_env.sh > /dev/null
```

### CMake

With emscripten set up, you can now configure the wasm and build it (in the in3-c directory):

```sh
# create a build directory
mkdir -p build
cd build

# configure CMake
emcmake cmake -DWASM=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MINSIZEREL ..

# and build it
make -j8 in3_wasm

# optionally you can also run the tests
make test
```

Per default the generated wasm embedded the wasm-data as base64 and resulted in the build/module.
If you want to build asmjs, use the `-DASMJS=true` as an additional option.
If you don't want to embedd the wasm, add `-DWASM_EMBED=false`.
If you want to set the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG` your filesize increases but all function names are kept (resulting in readable stacktraces) and emscriptten will add a lot of checks and assertions.

For more options please see the [CMake Options](https://in3.readthedocs.io/en/develop/api-c.html#cmake-options).

The Future of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence has come a long way – from rule-based scripts to Machine Learning algorithms that are beating human experts. 
The field has grown substantially in recent years. Machine Learning models are used to tackle different domain problems, and their 
impact on our lives is increasing steadily.

Nonetheless, there are still important questions that remain unanswered. To create more reliable models, we have to address these questions.

A crucial point is the measurement of intelligence. We do not have a general definition of intelligence yet. 
The current models that we describe as artificially intelligent are learning by memorizing the data we provide. That already yields 
astonishing results. Introducing a metric of intelligence and optimizing it will lead to far more powerful models in the future. 


It is exciting to experience the progression in AI and AGI.

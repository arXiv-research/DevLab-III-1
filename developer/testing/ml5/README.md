ml5.js is machine learning for the web in your web browser. 

Through some clever and exciting advancements, the folks building TensorFlow.js figured out that it is possible to
use the web browser's built in graphics processing unit (GPU) to do calculationsthat would otherwise run very slowly using
central processing unit (CPU). A really nice explanation of what is happening with GPUs can be found here.

Why are shaders fast?. ml5 strives to make all these new developments in machine learning on the web more
approachable for everyone.

/* A few users have reported having issues understanding backpressure and how to deal with it.
 *
 * Backpressure is the buildup of unacknowledged data; you can't just call ws.send without checking for backpressure.
 * Data doesn't just, poof, immediately jump from your server to the receiver - the receiver has to actually... receive it.
 * That happens with ACKs, controlling the transmission window.
 *
 * This applies to _EVERYTHING_ computer science (not just uWS); files, sockets, queues, and so on. If you're building
 * web services without taking backpressure into account you're not developing proper solutions - you're fucking around.
 *
 * Any slow receiver can wreck your whole server if you're not taking backpressure into account.
 *
 * The following is a (preposterous) example of how data can be pushed according to backpressure.
 * Do not take this as a way to actually write code, this is horrible, but it shows the concept clearly.
 *

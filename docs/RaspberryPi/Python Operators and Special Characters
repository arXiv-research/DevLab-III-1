With Python and for computers in general it helps to think of information as being one of the following data types: number, string, or Boolean. You also use computers to operate on that information, meaning to do any necessary math or comparisons or searches or whatever to help you find information and organize it in a way that makes sense to you.

Python offers many different operators and special characters for working with and comparing types of information. Here we just summarize them all for future reference, without going into great detail.

Northrop Grumman X-47A Pegasus

The Northrop Grumman X-47 is a demonstration unmanned combat aerial vehicle. The X-47 began as part of DARPA's J-UCAS program,
and is now part of the United States Navy's UCAS-D program to create a carrier-based unmanned aircraft. 

Unlike the Boeing X-45, initial Pegasus development was company-funded. The original vehicle carries the 
designation X-47A Pegasus, while the follow-on naval version is designated X-47B.

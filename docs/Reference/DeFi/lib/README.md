#repository and library for DeFi documentation and updates

Decentralized finance (commonly referred to as DeFi) is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on 
central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks to offer traditional financial instruments,
and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains, the most common being the Ethereum Virtual Machine. 

DeFi platforms/protocols allow people to lend or borrow funds from others, speculate on price movements on a range of assets using
derivatives, trade cryptocurrencies, insure against risks, and earn interest in savings-like accounts. 

DeFi uses a layered architecture and highly composable building blocks. Some DeFi applications promote high interest rates
but are subject to high risk. By October 2020, over $11 billion USD (worth in cryptocurrency) was deposited in various
decentralized finance protocols, which represented more than a tenfold growth during the course of 2020.

As of April-24-2021, approximately $53.5 Billion USD is invested in DeFi.

TorchScript allows you to serialize your models in a way that it can be loaded in non-Python environments. The LightningModule has a handy method to_torchscript() that returns a scripted module which you can save or directly use.

model = SimpleModel()
script = model.to_torchscript()

# save for use in production environment
torch.jit.save(script, "model.pt")


It is recommended that you install the latest supported version of PyTorch to use this feature without limitations.

In this section, we consider a 1-Lipschitz and L-smooth activation function, that is for all
s, t ∈ R,
|ψ(s) − ψ(t)| ≤ |s − t| and |ψ
0
(s) − ψ
0
(t)| ≤ L|s − t| . (10)
We also assume ψ(0) = 0 and denote c

ψ = EX∼N (0,1)[(ψ

(X))2
] which we assume to be
non-zero (that is ψ is not a constant function).

Proof. With the assumptions we have |ψ(X)| ≤ |X| and thus in Lemma 2 we can take
σ = c = 1 which yields the first claimed equation. For the second equation we use that
|ψ
0
(X)| ≤ 1 (since ψ is 1-Lipschitz) and thus, in Lemma 4, we can also take σ
0 = c
0 = 1
which yields the second claimed equation. 
Next we need to control (7) where we use crucially the smoothness of the activation
function.

6, we controlled Φ(v, δ) for a fixed v and δ. We now want to control it uniformly over
Ω = {(v, δ) : kvk = 1, kδk ≤ R}. To do so, we apply an union bound over an ε-net for Ω,
denote it Nε, whose size is then at most (10R/ε)
2d
. In particular; we obtain with probability
at least 1 − γ:
sup
(v,δ)∈Ω

Thus, it only remains to estimate the Lipschitz constant of the mapping Φ. To do so, note
that for any δ, δ0

|Φ(δ, v) − Φ(δ

Thus with see that with probability at least 1 − γ,

Combining this with (11) concludes the proof (by taking ε = 1/k and with straightforward
algebraic manipulations). 

Finally we can turn to the proof of Theorem 1:
Proof.[of Theorem 1] We make the following claims which hold with probability at least
1 − γ. With the assumptions on k, d and η, Lemma 5 shows that |f(x)| ≤ 0.1|η| and
k∇f(x)k ≥ c for some small constant c > 0. Moreover Lemma 7 shows that for all δ such
that kδk ≤ |η|/k∇f(x)k we have k∇f(x) − ∇f(x + δ)k ≤ c/10. Thus Lemma 1 easily allows
us to conclude (using in particular that f(x)(f(x) + η) < 0).

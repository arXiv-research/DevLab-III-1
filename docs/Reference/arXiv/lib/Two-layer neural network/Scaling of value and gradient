Here we show how to prove (2) and (3) (in fact, for our purpose, we only need the one-sided
inequality k∇f(x)k = Ω(1)) under very mild conditions on ψ which will be satisfied for
both ReLU and smooth activations. We will repeatedly use Bernstein’s inequality which we
restate here for convenience (see e.g., Theorem 2.10 in Boucheron et al. [2013]):
Theorem 3 (Bernstein’s inequality) Let (X`) be i.i.d. centered random variables such
that there exists σ, c > 0 such that for all integers q ≥ 2,
E[|X`
|

] ≤
q!

.
Then with probability at least 1 − γ one has:
X

2k log(1/γ) + c log(1/γ).
We will also use repeatedly that EX∼N (0,1)[|X|
q
] ≤ (q − 1)!! ≤
q!

, as well as the following
concentration of χ

random variables (see e.g., (2.19) in Wainwright [2019]): let X1, . . . , Xk
be i.i.d. standard Gaussians, then with probability at least 1 − γ, one has:

We can now proceed to our various results.

EX∼N (0,1)[|ψ(X)|

Lemma 3 Let ψ be differentiable almost everywhere. Then with probability at least 1 − γ

input: State at time step t St, available tasks at time
step t A(St), and the Q-network Q
output: A selected task from all available tasks at
 Threshold ε initialization
 idx ← random()
 if idx ≤ ε then
 at ←A task which is randomly chosen from ALt
 else
 Calculate Q(St)
 Q in list ← ∅
 for al ∈ A(St) do
 Q in list ← Q in list.append(Q(s, AL[i]))
 at ← argmax (Q in list)

new domain specific language (DSL) for developing decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchain. Glow is a language to develop
not just a smart contract, but an entire DApp itself, which also includes client code and formal proofs.


DApps—a “JavaScript for Blockchain”. We have a working prototype, and seek funding to turn it into a market-disrupting product.

A single mistake in a DApp can cause its users to lose all their assets. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital
assets were already lost this way. To avoid this catastrophic risk when writing a DApp today, you should hire top experts in
seven (7) different fields of Computer Science and Economics, in addition to your DApp’s own field: cybersecurity, cryptography,
distributed systems, systems programming, economic modelling, economic mechanism design, and one specific blockchain.

Then all these experts must somehow work together, just to support that one blockchain. All in all, writing a DApp with today’s 
tools feels a lot like digging for gold with toothpicks; and even the most advanced development platforms only offer you pickaxes. 
We at MuKn are building excavators instead.

 

Our team uniquely combines expertise in all above-mentionned fields, and also in Programming Languages and Formal Methods. 
We encoded our expertise in a language, Glow, that abstracts over the complexity of Blockchain. With our language,
you only need a single expert, in the subject matter of your DApp, whether it is derivatives trading, insurance, supply chain, 
etc. Our compiler and runtime take care of Blockchain.

Glow makes DApps vastly simpler, hence cheaper, faster and easier to write—but also to audit. To further simplify audit,
and unlike our competition, Glow has built-in support for formal methods to automate the verification of security properties. 


Note how independent audit is essential for DApps because users put their assets at risk with no recourse, which is not the case
with centralized applications. Also unlike our competition, our language will run on every blockchain, not just a single one you must 
bet on. DApp writers and users won’t care anymore which blockchain they use; Glow will therefore commoditize the underlying 
Blockchains and disrupt the market.

Everyone will use Glow. All financial institutions will use our services. We will provide the marketplace for blockchain services.
We will be the “Microsoft of Blockchain”.

Come join Mutual Knowledge Systems, Inc. in growing and using not just a DApp language, but an ecosystem that will give each individual,
each business, each association or institution, control over their own financial sovereignty. We are actively raising funds, seeking partners
hiring developers and courting users, to build what is poised to become a very large industry.

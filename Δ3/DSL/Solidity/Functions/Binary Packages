Binary packages of Solidity are available at solidity/releases.

We also have PPAs for Ubuntu, you can get the latest stable version using the following commands:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install solc
The nightly version can be installed using these commands:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum-dev
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install solc
We are also releasing a snap package, which is installable in all the supported Linux distros. To install the latest stable version of solc:

sudo snap install solc
If you want to help testing the latest development version of Solidity with the most recent changes, please use the following:

sudo snap install solc --edge
Arch Linux also has packages, albeit limited to the latest development version:

pacman -S solidity
We distribute the Solidity compiler through Homebrew as a build-from-source version. Pre-built bottles are currently not supported.

brew update
brew upgrade
brew tap ethereum/ethereum
brew install solidity
If you need a specific version of Solidity you can install a Homebrew formula directly from Github.

View solidity.rb commits on Github.

Follow the history links until you have a raw file link of a specific commit of solidity.rb.

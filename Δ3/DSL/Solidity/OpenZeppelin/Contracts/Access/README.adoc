This directory provides ways to restrict who can access the functions of a contract or when they can do it.

{AccessControl} provides a general role based access control mechanism. Multiple hierarchical roles can be created and assigned each to multiple accounts.

{Ownable} is a simpler mechanism with a single owner "role" that can be assigned to a single account. This simpler mechanism can be useful for quick tests but projects with production concerns are likely to outgrow it.

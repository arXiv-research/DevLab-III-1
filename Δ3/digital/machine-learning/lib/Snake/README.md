# LearnSnake: redistribution and development by Justin Mitchell

[italolelis.com/snake](https://italolelis.com/snake)

This is a implementation of an Artificial Intelligence fully written in **Javascript** that learns to play **Snake** using **Reinforcement Learning** (Q-Learning).

It runs directly in the browser. You don't need to setup an environment and no installation is necessary.

See it working and tweak some variables: [Try it yourself](https://italolelis.com/snake) !

# How it works

The first question I was asked when I came up with this idea: "Why do you want to use Javascript instead of Python?". I know Python has some libraries for scientific computing (like NumPy and TensorFlow), but I wanted something that worked right out of the box: no installation, running directly in the browser. This way, anyone can test and play with it without worrying about setting up a proper environment. This will be a fundamental key to future machine-learning advancements.

## Snake (the game itself)

Snake is a game in which a snake needs to explore an environment and catch the fruit without hitting any obstacle or itself. Every time the snake catches a fruit, its size increases.

I could have forked another Snake repository, but since I didn't know Javascript (and I would need to use it on the next steps), I thought that developing the Snake game from scratch would be a good idea to learn more about it.

To develop this part of the project, I used these contents for guidance:

- [Coding "Snake" in 4 min 30 sec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs)
- [Mastering the Module Pattern](https://toddmotto.com/mastering-the-module-pattern/) (not really about Snake itself, but a pattern I tried to follow on the project)

See [``game.js``](game.js) for the source code.

## Q-Learning

Accordingly to [Christopher Watkins](http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/~chrisw/), "Q-Learning is a simple way for agents to learn how to act optimally in controlled Markovian domains" ([Watkins, 1989](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00992698.pdf)). In simple terms, it uses a MDP ([Markov Decision Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process)) to control and make decisions in an environment. It consists of a Q-Table that is constantly updated.

A Q-Table is a matrix with a set of states and respective action's probability of success. When the agent explore the environment, the table is updated. The action with the biggest value is considered the best action to make.

In this guide I will explain how I applied Q-Learning in the Snake game. If you want to understand more deeply (yet in a simple way) about Q-Learning and Reinforcement Learning, I suggest this [Medium post](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/reinforcement-learning-6eacf258b265) by [Vishal Maini](https://twitter.com/v_maini).

See [``q-learning.js``](q-learning.js) for the source code.

### Algorithm

The algorithm consists of:

| function | explanation |
| -- | -- |
| **s** = game.state() | get state **s** |
| **act** = best-action( Q(s) ) | execute best action **act** given state **s**  |
| **rew** = game.reward( ) | receive reward **rew** |
| **s'** = game.state() | get next state **s'** |
| **Q(s, act)** = update-qTable( ) | update Q-Table value **q** of state **s** and action **act** |

### Update Q-Table

The new Q-Table value for the action accomplished is given by this formula (taken from the [article](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/reinforcement-learning-6eacf258b265) by Vishal Maini):

![](assets/update-q-value.png)

It's executed after the action is taken and the reward is known.

### Actions

Available actions are "**UP**", "**DOWN**", "**LEFT**" and "**RIGHT**", simulating a user interaction with the game.

| ↑ | ↓ | ← | → |
| -- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| UP | DOWN | LEFT | RIGHT |

The best action is selected by choosing the biggest action value in a certain state in the Q-Table. If the maximum value equals 0, a random action is selected.

### Reward

The only reward is given when the **snake grabs the fruit** ( **+1** ). I tried also giving a small reward (approximately +0.1) when it successfully explored the environment without dying, but the result was that the snake only moved on the environment in circles without really caring about the fruit.

The penalty happens whenever the **game resets** ( **-1** ), that is, the snake hits its tail or a wall.

If anything else happens, there's a minor negative reward ( -0.1 ). That's ideal to minimize the path taken to catch the fruit and makes the training process faster.

| Action | Reward |
|-----------------|----|
| Catch the Fruit | + 1 |
| Hits tail | - 1 |
| Hits wall | - 1 |
| Else | - 0.1 |

### States

First I tried creating a dictionary of states based on **all** the snake positions and trail formats. Although it worked, as a result of the high number of states, it was necessary to let the code train for a very long time. Since this project was intended to give a fast explanation and to show a fast result to the user (and the results are not saved across sessions), this way to save states in the dictionary was not the best approach.

To work around this limitation, the dictionary of states is based only in the **relative position of the fruit** to the head of the snake and the **relative position of the last tail section** to the head of the snake.

In this way, the dictionary of states stores the name like this:

The Q-Table is stored using a Javascript Object and looks like this:

If you want to test this algorithm with a full set of states, you can clone the project on GitHub and change a few lines to see how it behaves.
